# Chains

Here is the area where we hope to build network connectors for all chains across the cosmos ecosystem. Doing so makes capsule a compatible tool everywhere :D No more everyone writing scripts in many languages and repeating things. Either use capsule from the command line or script with it for any chain. 

These are the target chains and their support and any info I can think off.

### Terra

Terra seems to be the most unique one I have encountered in that it has both a chain url and fcd url. 
In my research most other cosmos chains have 1 REST_API endpoint instead.
